|      â””â”€â”€Projects
|          â”œâ”€â”€ Your Name
|          â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Project Name
|          â”‚    â”‚     â””â”€â”€ Code files
|          |    â”‚     â””â”€â”€ deployedLink.txt
|          |    |     â””â”€â”€ thumbnail.png
|          |    |
|          â”‚    â”‚
|          â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Project Name
|          â”‚          â””â”€â”€ Code files
|          |          â””â”€â”€ deployedLink.txt
